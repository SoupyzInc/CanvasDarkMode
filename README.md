A Stylus extension to give Canvas/myLearning a dark mode so your retinas don't have to burn out. Scroll down to see install instructions.

*I do not have access to the administrative view; any APs/teachers wanting to use this may experience graphical bugs.*

## Installation
1. Install the Stylus browser extension for [Chrome/Brave](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne), [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/stylus/), or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/).
2. Install the style through either [UserCSS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SoupyzInc/CanvasDarkMode/main/CanvasDarkMode.user.css) (reccomended) or [userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/styles/191622/mylearning-dark-mode) (May not be up to date. For me, this website takes 30 mins for anything to load).
3. This style looks best when High Contrast UI is disabled.
