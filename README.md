# Canvas/myLearning Dark Mode
A Stylus extension to give Canvas/myLearning a dark mode so your retinas don't have to burn out. Scroll down to see install instructions. This is still very WIP.

*I do not have access to the administrative view; any APs/teachers wanting to use this may experience graphical bugs.

## Installation
1. Install the Stylus browser extension for [Chrome/Brave](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne), [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/stylus/), or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/).
2. Install the style either through 
- [UserCSS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SoupyzInc/CanvasDarkMode/main/CanvasDarkMode.user.css) (reccomended; supports auto-updates) or through the 
- [userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/styles/191622/mylearning-dark-mode) (this website can be very laggy, so be patient).
3. This style has been optimized for High Contrast UI mode of Canvas. It is reccomended that you turn on High Contrast UI, under Account, in the left side bar.
